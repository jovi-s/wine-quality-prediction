# Wine Quality Prediction

This work was done as a part of an individual project for DSA5102 - Foundations
of Machine Learning offered by National University of Singapore during
Academic Year 2022/2023 Semester 1.

## Description

The aim of this project is to explore and test supervised and unsupervised 
learning models on a chosen dataset. I have decided to use the wine quality 
dataset specifically the white wine variant.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to determine:
1. If wines can be clustered based on their physiochemical input signals 
and thus if wines of a higher quaity can be identified from the determined clusters  
2. If white wine quality can be predicted based on the physiochemical input signals
